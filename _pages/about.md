## Welcome

My name is Michael Butros and I am the Director of Education at the Artificial Intelligence Institute for Advances in Optimization ([AI4OPT](https://www.ai4opt.org)) at the Georgia Institute of Technology ([GA Tech](https://www.gatech.edu)).

My involvement with AI4OPT began in Summer 2022 as a participant in the first cohort of the Faculty Training Program ([FTP](https://www.ai4opt.org/education/faculty-training)), which is offered through the institute to train faculty in Data Science techniques.

Before joining AI4OPT, I was a professor of physics and mathematics at Victor Valley College ([VVC](http://www.vvc.edu)), a two-year community college in Southern California, between 2000-2024. As a professor I was interested in the use of technology and computation in the introductory physics and mathematics courses.  I also used Mastery Grading, Peer Instruction, Inquiry Based Learning, and Flipped Classrooms techniques.  

While at VVC, I served as the chair of the Physics Department, the VVC Physics Club Advisor, and the Society of Physics Students Chapter Advisor.
